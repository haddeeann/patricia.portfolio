                    <h4>Hello.. a little introduction</h4>
                    <p>Hi. I'm a software and web developer. I've been developing different websites and software apps since 2015 full time. I've made useful things with all sorts of languages and technologies. But those are the technical specs aren't they? I'm the person behind the technical things.</p>
                    <p>I like to hike with my dog and take photos. The above photo was taken in Colorado recently. I also love to travel. So, no. I don't live in Colorado. I live where I'm at that moment. So, where I live changes. I love the comfort and convenience of being at home and cozy inside. But eventually I like to go to new locations and just check out the scene.</p>
                    <p>I'm vegan and I think healthy food makes a big difference in everyone's life. And my next move in life is making tech things that help people make healthy and good choices. I want to make software that makes the world just a little bit better. I believe small, significant changes over a long period can have a more profound impact that a dramatic change that falls apart after a week.</p>
                    <p>I love to do all sorts of things. I'm a creator and artist. I like sketching in pencil and inking different ideas. I find it very satisifying to doodle and create things. I also love to write. I am a big advocate for journalling every day and meditation.</p>
