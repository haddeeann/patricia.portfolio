                    <h4>Hello.. a little introduction</h4>
                    <p>Hi. I'm a software and full stack web developer. I've made useful things with all sorts of languages and technologies. But those are the technical specs aren't they? I'm the person behind the technical things.</p>
                    <p>I like to hike with my dog and take photos. I love to eat yummy vegan food. I also recently started my own company, <a href='https://www.yummyapps.io/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>Yummy Apps</a>. We make products that help people get organized and develop healthy habits.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a visual artist (love to make sketches and ink drawings). And I think meditation helps everyone have better health.</p>
