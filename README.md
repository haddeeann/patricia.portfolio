This is a portfolio page for Patricia Green. 
This branch is made with React and then the built version is deployed on my gh-pages and published. 

If you are here you are looking at my React code that is used to generate the portfolio page.

The work process is easy, develop on the main branch, commit and push code changes up to the main branch. Then when you're ready to deploy, run 'npm run deploy'. Note you need to have run 'npm run build' first in order to build the files that will be deployed.

That will build and push all the changes to the gh-pages branch. Then Netlify will pick up the changes and deploy them.
